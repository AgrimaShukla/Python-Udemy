# ABSTRACT CLASS
- An abstract class can be considered a blueprint for other classes.
- Allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class
- Main goal is to provide a way to test whether an object adheres to some specification
- It can also prevent any attempt to instantiate a subclass that doen't override a method in the superclass


# ABSTRACT METHOD
- An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation
- By defining an abstract base class, you can define a common API for set of subclasses
