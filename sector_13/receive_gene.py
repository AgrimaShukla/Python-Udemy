''' generators that receive data are no longer generators as they are not generating data,
they are receiving data so they are called co-routine because they take in data and can be suspended '''


'''
 generator-iterators begin execution at the top of the generatorâ€™s function body, there is no yield expression
 to receive a value when the generator has just been created. Therefore, calling send() with a non-None argument 
 is prohibited when the generator iterator has just started, and a TypeError is raised if this occurs (presumably due 
 to a logic error of some kind). Thus, before you can communicate with a coroutine you must first call next() or send(None)
   to advance its execution to the first yield expression.
